Regroup App
===========

A prototype. 

Testing
-------

Run `Regroup` on port `9393`, then run `test/check.sh`:

    ~/Disarray/regroup-app(branch:master) Â» test/check.sh                                                                            
    [-] unauthorized access check... [ GO ]
    [-] testing a proper call... [ GO ]
    [-] testing wrong credentials... [ GO ]

    [:] 3 GO / 0 NO GO
    [*] Well, nothing seems to be completely broken.
    
Quirks
